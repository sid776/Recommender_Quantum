                    <h3 class="mb-3">Innovation in Recommendation Systems</h3>
                    <p>
                        This platform demonstrates the power of quantum computing applied to recommendation systems.
                        Traditional recommendation algorithms struggle with the complexity of user preferences and vast content libraries.
                        Our quantum approach offers significant advantages in understanding patterns and relationships that classical algorithms might miss.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="mb-3">How It Works</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our system uses quantum-inspired algorithms that treat user preferences as quantum states.
                        This allows us to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Process complex patterns in user behaviors and preferences</li>
                        <li>Handle uncertainty in user interests more effectively</li>
                        <li>Discover non-obvious content relationships</li>
                        <li>Adapt to changing preferences more dynamically</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="mb-3">Personal Profiles</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our system learns from your viewing habits, explicit ratings, and theme preferences.
                        The more you interact with the platform, the more personalized your recommendations become.
                        Visit your <a href="{{ url_for('main.profile') }}">profile page</a> to customize your preferences directly.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="mb-3">Enhanced Personalization</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our system goes beyond typical recommendation engines by considering multiple layers of personalization:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Thematic preferences</strong> - Understanding the types of stories you enjoy beyond just genres</li>
                        <li><strong>Contextual awareness</strong> - Adapting recommendations based on when and how you watch</li>
                        <li><strong>Granular genre ratings</strong> - Allowing you to express nuanced preferences for different genres</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantum-enhanced similarity</strong> - Using quantum computing concepts to find non-obvious connections</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Unlike traditional systems that rely solely on "similar users liked this" approaches, our system creates a 
                        multi-dimensional understanding of both content and your preferences to discover recommendations you might 
                        never find otherwise.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 class="mb-3">Context-Aware Features</h3>
                    <p>
                        The system takes into account contextual factors like:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Time of day (different recommendations for morning vs. evening)</li>
                        <li>Viewing habits (binge watching vs. occasional viewing)</li>
                        <li>Content themes you enjoy</li>
                        <li>Genre preferences and ratings</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3 class="mb-3">Technology Stack</h3>

                        Our platform is built using:

                        <li>Flask web framework</li>
                        <li>Quantum-inspired algorithms for recommendation generation</li>
                        <li>User profile management with adaptive learning</li>
                        <li>Context-aware recommendation filtering</li>
